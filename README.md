# QTM 350
In this repository, I include all of my work from QTM 350: Data Sceince Computing. The course focused on Cloud computing and learning how to code in ways as to maximize team efficiency.

All work was done in Python3 using AWS and Google Colaboratory. The final project was a group effort, and my role was to use Transcribe in Sagemaker, create transcripts, and convert the outputs into a dataframe.

Softwares used in AWS include (but are not limited to): 
* Transcribe
* Polly
* SageMaker
* S3
* EC2
